A warrior cats name generator somewhat inspired by sunstartle's video [The Lost Art of Naming A Warrior Cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnjmorF2zrw).

## How it Works

The rules this generator abides by are somewhat arbitrary and I am sure somewhat buggy (so please let me know if you notice that something looks funky). For the most part, I am trying to create something that will make naturalistic, believable names but will not conform to only using canon name parts from the books. I also want to avoid any names that obviously do not work such as those with the same prefix and suffix, so no Moonmoon here unfortunately. Aside from that, I've added every other rule to just keep the names sounding and looking more manageable.

## Rules

1. Only naturalistic name parts are used, so no kittypet clause to allow something like Harveymoon.
2. No names with the same prefix and suffix.
3. No names longer than five syllables (the longest possible canon name is Dandelionblossom, which is five syllables).
4. No prefixes using the original clan leader's names, so no Thunder-, Wind-, Shadow-, River-, or Sky-.
5. No prefixes using position-indicative suffix words, so no Paw-, Star-, or Kit-.
